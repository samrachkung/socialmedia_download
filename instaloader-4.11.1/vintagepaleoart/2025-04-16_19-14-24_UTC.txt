Cynognathus by Jane Burton (miniature photography). From the book;
Time Exposure: A Photographic Record of the Dinosaur Age by Jane Burton and text by Dougal Dixon (1984)

“One of the most mammal-like of the mammal-like reptiles, Cynognathus has chased and brought down a plant-eating animal. Its cubs stayed near the den, resting out the hot afternoon in the shade of a conifer. Around them the sun beat down on the semi-arid Gondwanaland continent of the Lower Triassic. Now, towards evening, the adult Cynognathus has returned to feed the cubs, its stomach and mouth filled with meat which it has regurgitated for them. After the meal the young still gather round their parent, nosing its muzzle hoping for more food. They are very much part of a family group and it will be some time before they are old enough to take care of themselves.“
