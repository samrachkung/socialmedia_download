Tyrannosaurus rex by Harry Green, original artwork for Look and Learn issue number 968 published in 1980. Also on the front cover of the book I Spy - Dinosaurs & Prehistoric Animals (1993). 

Harry Green was born in 1920 in London, England.
He was a self-taught artist who began his career as a commercial artist, working for advertising agencies and designing posters for the London Underground. In the 1950s, he turned to painting and became known for his abstract expressionist style. He exhibited his work in numerous solo and group shows throughout his career, including at the Royal Academy of Arts in London.
Green’s work can be found in private collections and museums around the world, including the Tate Gallery in London and the Museum of Modern Art in New York. He continued to paint until his death in 2013 at the age of 93.

Look and Learn was a British weekly educational magazine for children published by Fleetway Publications Ltd from 1962 until 1982. It contained educational text articles that covered a wide variety of topics from volcanoes to the Loch Ness Monster; a long running science fiction comic strip, The Trigan Empire (a personal favorite of mine), and serialized works of fiction.
