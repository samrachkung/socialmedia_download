Happy Birthday, Dr. Bakker! Today is his 80th birthday. 
Illustration by Robert Thomas Bakker from his seminal book The Dinosaur Heresies (1986). 
His contribution and influence on Paleontology cannot be overstated. Along with his mentor John Ostrom, Bakker was responsible for initiating the ongoing “dinosaur renaissance” in paleontological studies, beginning with Bakker’s article “Dinosaur Renaissance” in the April 1975 issue of Scientific American.
