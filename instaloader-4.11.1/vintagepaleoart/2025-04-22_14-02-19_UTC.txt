Baryonyx by Jan Sovák as seen in the book The Great Dinosaurs by Zdeněk Špinar and Philip J. Currie (1994). 

“Looking more like a crocodile than a theropod because of its long, low skull, Baryonyx may have used the huge, sharp claws on its hands to capture fish in the Early Cretaceous rivers of England. Only one specimen has been found, and it had fish scales inside the rib cage.”
