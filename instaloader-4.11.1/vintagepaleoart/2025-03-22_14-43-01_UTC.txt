Pachycephalosaurus grangeri by Brian Franczak (1989 or ‘90) from the book Encyclopedia of Dinosaurs by Peter Dodson (1990) and National Audubon Society Pocket Guide to Familiar Dinosaurs (1993). 

“The largest pachycephalosaur was Pachycephalosaurus.
First found in rocks of Late Cretaceous age in Montana, Pachycephalosaurus was named and described by Barnum Brown and Eric Schlaikjer. Pachycephalosaurus is known only from a number of large domed skull roofs and a nearly complete skull. As the name Pachycephalosaurus (“thick-headed reptile”) indicates, the top of the skull was very thick, almost nine inches in some skulls. Unlike other pachycephalosaurs, the snout stuck out, giving it an almost piglike profile. The top of the dome was smooth, much like that of Prenocephale and Stegoceras.
The back rim of the dome of Pachycephalosaurus and the top of the snout were covered with spikes and small horns.
The teeth were simple, triangular blades. It ate soft plants.”
