Dinichthys and Cladoselache (Dunkleosteus and Cladoselache) by Zdeněk Burian (1967). 
Oil on canvas, 62.5 x 94 cm, currently at Zoo Dvůr Králové, originally planned for a school info-board/poster, which was never realized. 

Note: Dinichthys was originally described in 1868 by John Newberry on the basis of an incomplete skull roof and mandibles. Subsequently, many unrelated large arthrodires were originally classified together within this genus, including species now assigned to Dunkleosteus. Notably, the type species of Dunkleosteus was originally described as Dinichthys terrelli by Newberry in 1873, and was later separated into Dunkleosteus by Jean-Pierre Lehman in 1956.
