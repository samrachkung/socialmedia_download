Slide 6: Megalosaurus and Iguanodon - study II. (1941).

*Note regarding the Megalosaurus horn* :
At that time, on the basis of the species Megalosaurus bradleyi (later assigned to the genus Proceratosaurus), many paleontologists believed that Megalosaurus was related to Ceratosaurus. Augusta took this idea from Othenio Abel (whose statue of Ceratosaurus, created under his supervision by Franz Roubal, was originally named Megalosaurus), and that is why the Megalosaurus has a horn above its nose in the line drawing in the book Zavátý život (1941). 

Given the horn above its nose, most people believe that it is a Ceratosaurus/Proceratosaurus, but the text of the “study II.” drawing on the last slide makes it clear that it is a Megalosaurus.
