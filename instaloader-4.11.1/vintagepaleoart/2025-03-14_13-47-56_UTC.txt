Xenacanthida (or Xenacanthiformes) is an order or superorder of extinct shark-like chondrichthyans (cartilaginous fish) known from the Carboniferous to Triassic. 

Xenacanthus had a distinctive spine projected from the back of the head and gave the genus its name. The spike has even been speculated to have been venomous, perhaps in a similar manner to a sting ray. The teeth had an unusual “V” shape, and it probably fed on small crustaceans and heavily scaled palaeoniscid fishes.
