Cetiosaurus by Neave Parker (1961) commissioned by the @natural_history_museum also seen in the book Dinosaurs by W. E. Swinton (Dr William Elgin Swinton) (1962). The book was also a British Museum (Natural History) Publication. 

The eagle-eyed among you may spot an apparent fifth limb in Parker’s original depiction of Cetiosaurus. (Original artwork Slides 4-7) 
The ‘5th leg’ was edited out in the eventual publication (Slides 1-3), but still quite bizarre background information and worth a chuckle.
