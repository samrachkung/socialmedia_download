“Tallest” by William Stout (1981). Originally the animals were identified as Brachiosaurus and Supersaurus. As seen in Stout’s book The Dinosaurs: A Fantastic New View of a Lost Era (1981). 

The original illustration board which was auctioned off, has notes on the verso in Stout’s own hand: “’Tallest’ / Brachiosaurus confronts ‘Super Saurus’ / c.1981 Wm. Stout / La Brea Studio / 1981-82.”

The genera were later updated in his revised book The New Dinosaurs (2000) to Ultrasaurus and Brachiosaurus.
