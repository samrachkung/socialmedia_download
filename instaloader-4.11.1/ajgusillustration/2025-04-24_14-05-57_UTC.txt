For #ThrowbackThursday , a few adjustments I recently made to this Deinotherium  reconstruction. Read on.. 

Deinotherium…the “Terrible Beast”! This extinct genus of Proboscideans were among the largest terrestrial mammals ever to roam the earth. Deinotheres were one of several elephant-like families that lived during the Cenozoic, however their strange appearance distinguishes them from all others. Standing as tall as 13ft at the shoulders & weighing as much as 12 tons, Deinotherium sported large, backwards tusks - which extended from the lower jaw & were likely used for stripping vegetation from trees. Like other proboscids, Deinotherium likely had a trunk that it used for both gripping & drinking, although it’s exact length is the subject of debate.
