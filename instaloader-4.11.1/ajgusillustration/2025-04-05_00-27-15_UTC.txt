Psittacosaurus, or “parrot lizard,” was a small, beaked dinosaur that roamed ancient Asia between 125 and 105 million years ago. It’s one of the most fascinating dinosaurs we know—mainly because we know so much about it. With over 400 individuals found, including complete skeletons from hatchlings to adults, it’s arguably the most well-documented non-avian dinosaur ever discovered.

This early member of the ceratopsian family (the group that includes Triceratops) walked on two legs, had a high skull and a strong beak, and—remarkably—one fossil was found with long, bristle-like tail filaments, hinting at early feather-like structures or display features. Its brain and sensory anatomy suggest it was pretty sharp too, possibly active during both day and night, with keen vision and smell.

Originally placed in its own dinosaur family, Psittacosaurus is now seen as an early branch of the ceratopsian tree, closer to Triceratops than its older cousin Yinlong. And thanks to its fossil abundance, paleontologists even named a chunk of Early Cretaceous Asian rock layers after it—the Psittacosaurus biochron. It’s not just another little plant-eater; you could argue that it’s one of the clearest windows we have into the world of dinosaurs.
