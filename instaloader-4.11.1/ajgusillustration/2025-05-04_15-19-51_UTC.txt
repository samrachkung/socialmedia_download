Happy May the 4th! I figured I would celebrate by reposting an animal that looks like something out of a Star Wars movie ðŸ˜‚. May the 4th be with you! Read on..!

The saiga antelope is a strange and beautiful creature that inhabits the Eurasian steppe. The Saiga is easily recognized by its large, bulbous nose. It has adapted to its semidesert climate by evolving specialized nasal cavities that help filter out dust during large summer migrations, and warms frigid winter air before entering the lungs. 

With its herds once numbering in the millions, the Saiga is now critically endangered. Sadly, unregulated hunting and poaching have seen its global populations dwindle by over 95% in the past several decades.
